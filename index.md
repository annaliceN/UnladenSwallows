### Introduction

####  The Problem

What are birds? 

Seemingly everywhere, birds can be found at almost any time of the day. Their tweets can wake you up at the crack of dawn, they can be found assailing innocent passersby for food around noon and seen crowing ominously in the trees at dusk. Yet how do you identify birds? What is the difference between a crow and a raven? Do birds even exist?

These deep philosophical questions are what prompted us to work on classifying different bird species for our final project. Through the Birds! Kaggle Competition, our goal was to train a model that would classify birds in an image. This would allow us to answer important questions like

> How do you tell the difference between an African and European swallow? <

And many more!
